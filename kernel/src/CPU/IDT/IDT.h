//Struct Padding and packing
//#pragma push, this pragma saves the current pragma state.

//#pragma pop this pragma restores the previously saved pragma state.

//#pragma pack(push, 1) means to set the original alignment of the stack, and set a new alignment to a byte alignment

//Structure padding increases the size of the structure and creates empyt room in order to save the processors cycles (memory will be wasted)

//Structure packing, we can avoid waisting memory by using #pragma pack(1)
